    <h1>Evidence</h2>
    <p>The data we collected was in two parts, from our project and from the actual mystery black box. From the actual mystery black box, we poured in many different amounts of water at a time and then measured the amount that poured out. With some exceptions, the amount of water that went in was usually more than what had come out. A notable data piece was that when we poured in 3000mL, a much bigger amount than previous tests, the box started to leak from the side a bit. From our project of trying to replicate the box, we got a not similar result to the box. The amount of water poured in was almost always around the amount poured out. The most notable part was a set of three 50mL tests, a short amount, in a row and only got 135mL after the third test; the first two did not output anything.</p>
